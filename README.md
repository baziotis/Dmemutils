# Dmemmove

This is part of my [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6103365956665344/#5475582328963072), _Independency of D from the C Standard Library_.

The purpose of the project is to replace basic memory utilities (memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp) currently provided
by the C Standard Library.

`noc` folder holds any common code.

`Dmemset` contains the work on the replacement of `memset()` of the C Standard Library.

`Dmemmove` contains the work on the replacement of `memmove()/memcpy()` of the C Standard Library.

`Dmemcmp` contains the work on the replacement of `memcmp()` of the C Standard Library.

You can move in any of the above 3 folders to compile and run a test-suite and a benchmark suite.
